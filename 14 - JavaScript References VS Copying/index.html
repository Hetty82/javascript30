    // start with strings, numbers and booleans - they are copied by value
    let age = 100
    let age2 = age
    console.log(age, age2) // 100 100
    age = 200
    console.log(age, age2) // 200 100

    let name = 'hetty'
    let name2 = name
    console.log(name, name2) // hetty hetty
    name = 'froukje'
    console.log(name, name2) // froukje hetty

    let bool = true
    let bool2 = bool
    console.log(bool, bool2) // true true
    bool = false
    console.log(bool, bool2) // false true

    // Now move to objects and arrays - they are copied by reference
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Froukje'
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log('using = assignment:\n', players, team) // players is also updated!

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We make a copy instead!
    // one day
    const team2 = players.slice() // slice will return a new array
    team2[3] = 'Hetty'
    console.log('using slice():\n', players, team2)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team4 = [].concat(players) // will add players' items into new empty
    team4[3] = 'Hetty'
    console.log('using [].concat():\n', players, team4);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread, Array.from() or map()
    const team5 =  [...players] // will spread all players' items into new array
    team5[3] = 'Hetty'
    console.log('using ...spread:\n', players, team5);

    const team6 = Array.from(players) // will create a new array from any list of items
    team6[3] = 'Hetty'
    console.log('using Array.from():\n', players, team6);

    const team3 = players.map(player => player) // map will return a new array
    team3[3] = 'Hetty'
    console.log('using map():\n', players, team3)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Hetty de Vries',
      age: 80
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    captain.age = 99
    console.log(person, captain); // same here, both are updated!

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 120 })
    // person and captain reference the same object, captain2 references a new object
    console.log(person, captain, captain2);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const captain3 = {...person}
    // console.log(captain3) // SyntaxError, this doesnt exist yet

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes)
    console.log(wes, dev) // same same

    dev.name = 'Wesley'
    console.log(wes, dev) // only dev has changed

    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'
    console.log('wes:\n', wes, '\ndev:\n', dev) // twitter has changed in both

    // another way to deep clone (apart from lodash cloneDeep)
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(dev))
    console.log('dev2:\n', dev2)

    dev2.social.twitter = '@reallycoolman'
    console.log('dev:\n', dev, '\ndev2:\n', dev2) // twitter has only changed in dev2
